}
print(index)
index += 10
}
***

}
***

var numberRange = 20...150
for i in numberRange where i%3 == 0{
print("\(i) is divisible by 3")
}

***

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Your explanation here
```
//infinite loop because 5 will always be greater than 3 therefore the loop is always true
***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
//var i = 5
//
//while (i < 9) {
//    i += 1
//    print("\(i)")
//}
***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
var i = 5

while (i < 5005) {
i += 5
print("\(i)")
}
***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
``` 
//var i = 5
//
//while (i < 5005) {
//    i += 5
//    print("\(i) ") }
//    if i%2 == 0 {
//        print("max number \(i) is even")
//    }
//    else {
//        print("btw, max is number \(i) is odd :(")
//    }

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
//var i = 1
////loop one
//while i <= 10 {
//    print("i = \(i)")
//    i += 1
//}

//loop two
//var i = 1
//
//repeat {
//    print("i = \(i)")
//    i += 1
//} while i <= 10
//no difference because both loops have the same conditions
***
## Question 16

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.
//continue ends a certain part of the loop while break ends the whole thing***
## Question 17

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10
//1, 2, 3, 8, 9 , 10
***
## Question 18

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10
//1, 2, 3***
## Question 19

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```
//x = 1, y = 1
//x = 2, y = 1
//x = 3, y = 1
***
## Question 20

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.
xAxis: for xAxis in 0...10 {
yAxis: for yAxis in 0...10 {
if yAxis == 10{
continue xAxis
}
print("\(xAxis),  \(yAxis)")
}
}
***
## Question 21

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 22

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).



Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

*** 

//var N = 1...10
//var index = 1;
//for index in N {
//    index += index
//    print(index)
//}

## Question 23

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift
***
***
***
```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
